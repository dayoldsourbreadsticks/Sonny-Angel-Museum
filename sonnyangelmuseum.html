		<p><strong>Sonny Angel Hippers</strong> are a fun and creative twist on the classic Sonny Angel figurines, bringing 
		a new way to display these adorable collectibles. Unlike traditional Sonny Angels, which stand upright 
		on flat surfaces, Hippers are designed to stick onto a variety of places, adding a playful and whimsical
		touch to your surroundings. Each Hipper comes with an adhesive pad on its lower back, allowing it to 
		securely "hip" onto surfaces like the edge of a desk, a computer monitor, a bookshelf, or even the cover 
		of a book. This unique design makes it look as though the little figurine is peeking out or playfully 
		hanging on, adding a bit of charm and surprise wherever you place it. Whether you're a longtime Sonny Angel 
		collector or new to the world of these cute figures, Hippers offer a fresh and interactive way to enjoy them.
		Plus, their compact size and secure grip make them easy to place and reposition, letting you get creative
		with where you display your favorite characters.</p>
